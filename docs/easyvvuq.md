# Sensitivity analysis using FabSim3 and EasyVVUQ

FabSim3 is very useful when submitting a large number of jobs at together. One of the cases where this becomes especially useful is for sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis can be breifly described as the process of evaluating the extent to which various input parameters affect the output of a simulation. One of the popular ways of quantifying this effect of parameters on the simulations is throgh Sobol Indices. Computation of Sobol Indices involves running the simulation for a large number of parameter sets and then comuting the variances among the various subsets of results obtained. Given the large number of computations required, this becomes a suitable candidate for simplification using FabSim3.

In this tutorial, we showcase how to conduct sensitivity analysis using FabSim3 and the python packages EasyVVUQ and QCG-PilotJob. The tutorial will use a simple plugin called `FabDynamics` which has been tailored for this purpose.

## Brief introduction of Dynamics and FabDynamics

At the core of this tutorial is the `Dynamics` software which numerically solves a system of differential equations for a fixed amount of time. By default, if no arguments are provided, the program solves the FitzHugh-Nagumo system of differential equations:

$$ \dfrac{dx}{dt} = \dfrac{x^3}{3} - x + \dfrac{1}{2} $$

$$ \dfrac{dy}{dt} = \dfrac{x + a - by}{c} $$

where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are three real-valued parameters that determine the time-evolution of dynamical variables $x$ and $y$.

In order to use FabSim3 with the `Dynamics` software, we use the `FabDynamics` plugin. This plugin would help us submit large ensembles of simulation runs and perform sensitivity analysis. We discuss this aspect of the plugin in the following sections of the tutorial.

## Installing Dynamics

In order to install the `Dynamics` software:

1. Clone the software repository in a directory of your choice:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/arindamsaha1507/dynamics.git
    ```
2. Enter the newly created directory:
    ```sh
    cd dynamics
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. This should complete the installation process. Check that the software works properly by issuing the command:
    ```sh
    python run.py
    ```
    This should create a new file called `timeseries.csv` which contains the time-evolution of variables $x$ and $y$.

5. To check that the results are as expected, you can plot the results using:
    ```sh
    python plotter.py
    ```
    This should result in a plot similar to the one shown below.

</figure>

## Installing FabDynamics

Now, with the `Dynamics` software installed, we must install the `FabDynamics` plugin so that we can use it with FabSim3:

1. With FabSim3 installed properly, issue the following command:
    ```sh
    fabsim localhost install_plugin:FabDynamics
    ```
    This should create a `FabDynamics` subdirectory in the `FabSim3/plugins` directory.

2. Change to the newly created directory:
    ```sh
    cd <path to FabSim3 directory>/plugins/FabDynamics
    ```

3. Copy the contents of the `machines_FabDynamics_user_example.yml` file into a new file `machines_FabDynamics_user.yml`:
    ```sh
    cp machines_FabDynamics_user_example.yml machines_FabDynamics_user.yml 
    ```

4. Now edit the the last line of the `machines_FabDynamics_user.yml` file with the location where dynamics software is installed:

    ```yaml
    default:

    dynamics_args:

        outfile: 'timeseries.csv'

    localhost:

    # location of dynamics in your local PC
    dynamics_location: "<path/to/dynamics/software>"
    ```

## Perfoming sensitivity analysis and computing Sobol Indices

The `FabDynamics` plugin comes pre-configured for sensitivity analysis. In order to start sensitivity analysis with default settings, simply issue the command:

```sh
fabsim localhost dyn_init_SA:config=fhn
```

!!! note
    If you wish to use QCG-PilotJob during the SA runs on HPC's, simply modify the command as
    ```sh
    fabsim <machine_name> dyn_init_SA:config=fhn,PJ=True
    ```
    Please ensure that QCG-PilotJob is installed on the machine beforehand.

Based on the pre-set configuration, issuing this command selects 64 points in the three-dimensional parameter space defined by parameters $a$, $b$ and $c$. It then submits one simulation run for each parameter set to the localhost.

After all the simulation runs have successfully run, the results of the simulations can be collected and analysed using a single command:

```sh
fabsim localhost dyn_analyse_SA:config=fhn
```

Issuing this command also computes the Sobol indices at each point in the timeseries. The results of this analysis are stored in the directory: 

```
<path to FabSim3 directory>/plugins/FabDynamics/SA/dyn_SA_SCSampler
```

In this directory

- The first order Sobol indices are stored in `sobols.yml`. The contents of this file should look like:

    ```yaml
    campaign_info:
        name: "dyn_SA_SCSampler"
        work_dir: "/home/arindam/FabSim3/plugins/FabDynamics"
        num_runs: 64
        output_column: "x"
        polynomial_order: 3
        sampler: "SCSampler"
        distribution_type: "Uniform"
        sparse: "False"
        growth: "False"
        quadrature_rule: "G"
        midpoint_level1: "False"
        dimension_adaptive: "False"
    a:
        # arithmetic mean i.e., (x1 + x2 + … + xn)/n
        sobols_first_mean: 0.435
        # geometric mean, i.e., n-th root of (x1 * x2 * … * xn)
        sobols_first_gmean: 0.4329
        sobols_first: [0.5201, 0.5201, 0.5201, 0.5201, 0.52, 0.52, 0.52, 0.5199, 0.5199,  0.3959, 0.3956, 0.3953, 0.395, 0.3947, 0.3945, 0.3942, 0.3938, 0.3935]
    b:
        # arithmetic mean i.e., (x1 + x2 + … + xn)/n
        sobols_first_mean: 0.011
        # geometric mean, i.e., n-th root of (x1 * x2 * … * xn)
        sobols_first_gmean: 0.0085
        sobols_first: [0.0042, 0.0042, 0.0041, 0.0041, 0.004, 0.004, 0.004, 0.0039, 0.0039, 0.0039, 0.0038, 0.0038, 0.0037, 0.0037, 0.0037, 0.0036, 0.0036, 0.0036, 0.0036, 0.0035, ... 0.0069, 0.007, 0.007, 0.007, 0.0071, 0.0071, 0.0072, 0.0072, 0.0073, 0.0073]
    c:
        # arithmetic mean i.e., (x1 + x2 + … + xn)/n
        sobols_first_mean: 0.0382
        # geometric mean, i.e., n-th root of (x1 * x2 * … * xn)
        sobols_first_gmean: 0.0288
        sobols_first: [0.0097, 0.0098, 0.0099, 0.01, 0.0101, 0.0102, 0.0103, 0.0104, 0.0105, 0.0106, 0.0107, ... 0.0197, 0.0195, 0.0194, 0.0192, 0.0191, 0.0189, 0.0188, 0.0186, 0.0185, 0.0183, 0.0182]
    ```

    As evident from the contents of the file, the first order Sobol indices for each parameter is computed separately.

- The plot of the first-order Sobol indices is stored in `plot_sobols_first[x].png`. The plot should look similar to:

<figure>
    <img src="../images/plot_sobols_first[x]" width="600"> 
</figure>

- Similar plot showing all Sobol indices (inclding the higher order indices) is stored in `plot_all_sobol[x].png`. The plot should look similar to:

<figure>
    <img src="../images/plot_all_sobol[x].png" width="600"> 
</figure>

- The command also creates other plots related to the results of the simulation runs, namely `raw[x].png` and `plot_statistical_moments[x].png`.

## Configuring sensitivity analysis

After the steps taken above, the dirctory structure of the FabDynamics plugin should look like:

```
FabDynamics
├── config_files
│   ├── fhn
│   └── testing
├── FabDynamics.py
├── LICENSE
├── machines_FabDynamics_user_example.yml
├── machines_FabDynamics_user.yml
├── __pycache__
│   ├── FabDynamics.cpython-310.pyc
│   └── FabDynamics.cpython-38.pyc
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── SA
│   ├── dyn_SA_config.yml
│   ├── dyn_sa.py
│   ├── dyn_SA_SCSampler
│   └── __pycache__
└── templates
    ├── dynamics
    ├── params.json
    └── template_inputs
```

Out of these files, the following determine the configuration for senstivity analysis:

The **dyn_sa.py** module contains the central function that controls the sensitivity analysis. So, when we issue the command:

```sh
fabsim localhost dyn_init_SA:config=fhn
```

The following function in `dyn_sa.py` is run:

```python
@task
@load_plugin_env_vars("FabDynamics")
def dyn_init_SA(config,
                outdir=".",
                script="dynamics",
                dynamics_script="run.py",
                sampler_name=None,
                ** args):
```

with the argument `config=fhn`.

After the required pre-processing, this function creates an EasyVVUQ campaign in the following line:

```python
runs_dir, campaign_dir = init_dyn_SA_campaign(
        campaign_name=campaign_name,
        campaign_config=dyn_SA_campaign_config,
        polynomial_order=polynomial_order,
        campaign_work_dir=campaign_work_dir,
        template='template_inputs',
        target='inputs.yml'
    )
```

The specifics of how the sensitivity analysis campaign would work is defined in the arguments of the `init_dyn_SA_campaign()` function. In particular, the `template='template_inputs'` and `target='inputs.yml'` arguments specify that the `inputs.yml` configuration file for the individual run has to be formatted according to the `template_inputs` template file.

Let us have a look at the `inputs.yml` file in the `FabDynamics/config_files/fhn/configuration/` directory:

```yaml
family: 'ode'

ode_system: 'fhn'

parameters:
  a: 
    min: -1.0
    max: 1.0
    default: 0.7
  b: 
    min: 0.0
    max: 1.0
    default: 0.8
  c:
    min: 0.0
    max: 20.0
    default: 12.5

initial_conditions:
  x: 
    min: -5.0
    max: 5.0
    default: 0.1
  y:
    min: -5.0
    max: 5.0
    default: 0.1

time:
  ti: 0.0
  tf: 1000.0
  dt: 0.01
  tr: 0.8
```

This is very similar to the `template_inputs` template file in the `FabDynamics/templates/` directory:

```yaml
family: 'ode'

ode_system: 'fhn'

parameters:
  a: 
    min: -1.0
    max: 1.0
    default: $a
  b: 
    min: 0.0
    max: 1.0
    default: $b
  c:
    min: 0.0
    max: 20.0
    default: $c

initial_conditions:
  x: 
    min: -5.0
    max: 5.0
    default: 0.1
  y:
    min: -5.0
    max: 5.0
    default: 0.1

time:
  ti: 0.0
  tf: 1000.0
  dt: 0.01
  tr: 0.8
```

In fact, the only difference between the two files is that instaed of numerical values for keys `a`, `b` and `c`, the template file contains symbols `$a`, `$b` and `$c`. 

Essentially the `init_dyn_SA_campaign()` function copies the `template='template_inputs'` into `target='inputs.yml'` file after substituting the `$` variables with numerical values. The algorithm by which the numerical values are substituted are determined by `dyn_SA_config.yml` and `params.json` files.

Let us look at the `dyn_SA_config.yml` file:

```yaml
vary_parameters_range:
    # <parameter_name:>
    #   range: [<lower value>,<upper value>] 
    a:
        range: [-1.0, 1.0]
    b:
        range: [0.5, 0.9]
    c:
        range: [12.0, 13.0]

selected_vary_parameters: ["a",
                           "b",
                           "c",
                          ]

distribution_type: "Uniform" # Uniform, DiscreteUniform

polynomial_order: 3

decoder_output_column: "x"

#   ---------------------------------------------------------------
# sampler_name: str
#   Samplers in the context of EasyVVUQ are classes that generate
#   sequences of parameter dictionaries.
#   available sampler: [SCSampler,PCESampler]
#
#   SCSampler: Stochastic Collocation sampler
#   PCESampler : Polynomial Chaos Expansion
#   ---------------------------------------------------------------
sampler_name: "SCSampler"


# quadrature_rule : char
#     The quadrature method, default is Gaussian "G".
#     "G" -> Gaussian , "C" -> Clenshaw_Curtis
quadrature_rule: "G"

# ------- NOTE ------------
# if you set quadrature_rule="C", then you need to make sure
#     sparse=True
#     growth=True
#     midpoint_level1=True


# sparse : bool
#             If True use sparse grid instead of normal tensor product grid,
#             default is False
sparse: False

# growth: bool
#     Sets the growth rule to exponential for Clenshaw Curtis quadrature,
#     which makes it nested, and therefore more efficient for sparse grids.
#     Default is False.
growth: False

# midpoint_level1: bool,  ----- ONLY FOR SCSampler ------
#     determines how many points the 1st level of a sparse grid will have.
#     If midpoint_level1 = True, order 0 quadrature will be generated
midpoint_level1: False

# dimension_adaptive: bool, ----- ONLY FOR SCSampler ------
#     determines wether to use an insotropic sparse grid, or to adapt
#     the levels in the sparse grid based on a hierachical error measure
dimension_adaptive: False

# regression: bool, ----- ONLY FOR PCESampler ------
#    If True, regression variante (point collecation) will be used,
#    otherwise projection variante (pseud-spectral) will be used.
#    Default value is False.
regression: False

```

This file determines the overall configuration of the sensitivity analysis. In particular, the key `selected_vary_parameters` determines the variables with respect to which the sensitivity analysis is to be performed. Therefore, in the example, variables `a`, `b` abd `c` would be varied. The ranges in which the variables will be varied is determined by the `vary_parameters_range` key. 

Therefore, during the analysis in the example, the parameters are scanned in a three-dimensional space. The granularity with which the parameter space is scanned is determined by the `polynomial_order` key. With a `polynomial_order` of $n$, a total of $n+1$ samples will be taken for each parameter. If there are a total of $p$ parameters to be varied, there will be a total of $(n+1)^p$ samples taken from the parameter space. Therefore, in the example above an ensemble size of $4^3=64$ will be created.

The `decoder_output_column` key in the `dyn_SA_config.yml` file determines the column in the output file based on which the the Sobol indices are to be computed. In addition, the file also determines other factors such as the sampler and other EasyVVUQ specific parameters. These are explained in detain in the comments of the file.

Finally, we note the role of `params.json` file in configuring the sensitivity analysis. Let us first look at the file:

```json
{
    "a": {
      "type": "float",
      "min": -1.0,
      "max": 1.0,
      "default": 0.7
    },
    "b": {
      "type": "float",
      "min": 0.0,
      "max": 1.0,
      "default": 0.8
    },
    "c": {
      "type": "float",
      "min": 0.0,
      "max": 20.0,
      "default": 12.5
    },
    "out_file": {
      "type": "string",
      "default": "timeseries.csv"
    }
}
```

The file first lists the variables that **are allowed** to be varied, which are `a`, `b` and `c`. It also lists the `out_file` variable which gives the file in which the output file will be written. 

Similar to the `dyn_SA_config.yml` file, the `params.json` file also states a mininum and a maximum value of the parameters. This is because, the `params.json` file is meant to be system-specific, whereas the `dyn_SA_config.yml` file is meant to be spficit to the current sensitivity analysis run. Hence, the limits set in `params.json` file are supposed to be the *theoretical* limits of the variables. However, the limits in the `dyn_SA_config.yml` file determines the *actual* limits within which the values of the variables will be varied during the sensitivity analysis. Therefore, the limits set in `dyn_SA_config.yml` must be a subset of the limits set in `params.json` file.

The `params.json` file also specifies a `default` value for each variable. This is the value given to the variable when it is not being used in a particular run of sensitivity analysis. Therefore, if the `selected_vary_parameters` key in the `dyn_SA_config.yml` file is set to `[a, b]`, value of `$c` that will be substitute in `template_inputs` will be `12.5` as that is the `default` value assigned to `c` in `params.json` file.
